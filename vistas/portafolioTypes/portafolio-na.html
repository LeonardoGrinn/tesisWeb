          This project was made for an old school businessman. After our first meeting, 
          we agreed to revamp the whole company's branding. Christian Soto and I worked 
          side by side updating their logo, and he made a fantastic job! I then I designed 
          and coded the new elegant and minimalistic Industrial Mueblera's website all 
          from scratch.

          The specification was clear; the client wanted something simple but classy. 
          He came to me with just an idea because his company was barely starting. 
          He had a name and a concept in mind already though. Therefore, I contacted 
          Christian Soto so he could help me create a fancy logo, and after we defined 
          the colors and the basic branding, I designed and coded a single page website 
          for him.

          The restaurant’s owner had a specific need. He wanted that his customers 
          could check out the restaurant’s menu online at anytime. So I’ve designed 
          his website based on the restaurant’s branding and implemented an effective 
          SEO strategy so the menu could appear easily in Google’ search results. He 
          was thrilled to find about all the stuff you can do with Google AdWords.

          This is a great company website design example. Etérea has multiple artists, 
          so they wanted a way to show their collections separately. For that reason, 
          I developed a fully manageable and responsive website for them, with 
          custom-made private galleries and easy contact channels for their customers.
